This project is a simple demonstration of how machine learning can be used to detect phishing websites based on the structure of their URLs. The program analyzes features from the URL and uses a Random Forest model to classify it as phishing (1) or safe (0).

Make sure Python and pip are installed. Then install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

ach item in the list contains:

A URL

A label:
